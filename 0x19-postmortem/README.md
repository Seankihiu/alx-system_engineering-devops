Issue Summary

Duration:
Outage started at 2024-05-02 09:00 EAT and ended at 2024-05-03 05:00 EAT.

Impact:
The internal development server for the "HakunaMatata" application experienced a catastrophic failure. Developers were unable to push or pull code changes, causing widespread panic and excessive coffee consumption among 75% of our developers.

Root Cause:
A broken package installation led to a dependency apocalypse that could not be resolved, necessitating a complete server reinstallation.

Timeline

When it all went south:

09:00 EAT: Developer Jim couldn't push his "brilliant" new feature; panic ensued.
09:15 EAT: Jim yelled, "It's not me, it's the server!" and called IT.
09:30 EAT: IT, armed with snacks and caffeine, tested the network. No dice.
10:00 EAT: Network fine, but server behaving like a moody teenager.
11:00 EAT: Logs revealed a mess of broken packages. Cue collective groan.
12:00 EAT: Tried uninstalling broken packages; server laughed in our faces.
13:00 EAT: Senior sysadmin, the "Server Whisperer," was called in.
15:00 EAT: Decision made to start fresh. Backup process initiated.
16:00 EAT: Data backup began, hoping for the best, preparing for the worst.
18:00 EAT: Backup done, crossed fingers and reinstalled the OS.
21:00 EAT: OS installed. Now, the real fun began—setting up software.
23:00 EAT: Reinstallation of development tools and dependencies, with prayers.
02:00 EAT: Data restoration; sysadmin chanted ancient incantations.
04:00 EAT: System functionality verified. Miraculously, no major issues.
05:00 EAT: Developers rejoiced; normal service resumed. Coffee stocks depleted.
Root Cause and Resolution

Root Cause:
The root cause was a disastrous package installation. During a routine update, a critical package threw a tantrum and corrupted everything in sight. This caused a dependency nightmare that our best efforts couldn't untangle.

Resolution:
The only solution was a full server exorcism—ahem, reinstallation. Steps included:

Backup: Saved all essential data, praying nothing was missed.
OS Reinstallation: Wiped the slate clean and reinstalled the operating system.
Software Setup: Carefully reinstalled development tools, avoiding any more package tantrums.
Data Restoration: Restored backed-up data, crossing fingers and toes.
Corrective and Preventative Measures

Let’s make sure this never happens again:

Improvements/Fixes:

Automated Backups: No more living on the edge—backups are now daily.
Containerization: Moving to Docker because containers don't throw tantrums.
Staging Environment: Testing updates in a sandbox before unleashing them on the main server.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Automate Backups: Schedule daily backups so we can sleep at night.
Containerization: Transition to Docker containers for dependency management.
Update Procedures: Implement a staging environment for pre-deployment testing.
Monitoring: Upgrade monitoring to catch package issues before they spiral out of control.
Documentation: Update our "Oh no, it's broken!" guide with new procedures.
Training: Teach our team to handle package dependencies like pros.
By taking these steps, we’ll avoid future dependency disasters and keep our developers coding and caffeinated, just the way they like it.

Remember, laughter might not fix servers, but it makes the postmortem a lot more bearable.
